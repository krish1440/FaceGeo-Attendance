1. Allow Only One Attendance Per Day    doen >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Solution and Suggestions:

Check for Existing Attendance: Before marking attendance in the /mark_attendance endpoint, query the attendance table to check if an entry already exists for the user on the current date. If an entry exists, reject the new attendance request with an appropriate error message.

User Feedback: Provide clear feedback to the user (e.g., "Attendance already marked for today") in the UI if they attempt to mark attendance more than once.

Files/Templates to Modify:
Backend:
app.py (Modify the /mark_attendance endpoint to add a check for existing attendance records before inserting a new one.)
Database schema (Add a unique constraint to the attendance table in Supabase for user_id, org_id, and data.)
Frontend:
templates/mark_attendance.html (Update to display an error message if attendance is already marked for the day.)

3. Calculate Attendance Percentage
Solution and Suggestions:

Attendance Percentage Logic:
Calculate the percentage as:
Attendance % = (Number of days marked PRESENT or ACCEPTED) / (Total number of days in the period) * 100.
Fetch attendance records for a user within a specified date range (e.g., from start_date to end_date).
Count the days with status='ACCEPTED' (or PRESENT if you introduce this status).
Calculate total days in the range (excluding weekends or holidays if applicable, based on organization rules).
Return the percentage in the response.
Implementation Options:
User Dashboard: Display the attendance percentage for the current month or a user-selected period on the user’s dashboard (/user_dashboard).
Attendance Summary: Add a column or section in the organization’s attendance summary (/attendance_summary) to show each user’s attendance percentage for the selected date range.
CSV Export: Include the attendance percentage in the CSV export generated by /attendance_summary or /view_attendance.
Edge Cases:
Handle cases where no attendance records exist (e.g., new users or no data in the date range) by returning 0% or an appropriate message.
Account for partial days (e.g., if a user joins mid-month) by adjusting the total days denominator.
UI Integration: Display the percentage in a visually clear way (e.g., a progress bar or a dedicated stats section) in the relevant templates.
Files/Templates to Modify:

Backend:
app.py (Update /attendance_summary to calculate and return attendance percentages for each user. Update /view_attendance to include percentage for the logged-in user. Optionally, add a new endpoint for fetching percentage data.)
Frontend:
templates/attendance_summary.html (Add a column or section to display attendance percentages for each user in the organization’s view.)
templates/view_attendance.html (Add a section to show the user’s attendance percentage for the selected date range.)
templates/user_dashboard.html (Optionally, display the user’s attendance percentage for the current month or a default period.)













Backend: Flask (Python) for API endpoints and routing.
Frontend: HTML with embedded CSS and JavaScript (using face-api.js for face recognition and Leaflet.js for maps).
Database: Supabase for authentication, user data, attendance records, and geofencing.
Assumptions: Supabase handles user/organization authentication and storage; face recognition and geofencing validation are processed via backend API calls.
